This also means that since users create the router - there's no longer any difference in the rendering aspect for memory/browser/hash routers (which only impacts router/history creation) - so we can get rid of those and trim to a simple <code>RouterProvider</code></p>\n<pre lang=\"jsx\"><code>// Before\nfunction App() {\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n    &lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot; element={&lt;Layout /&gt;}&gt;\n      &lt;Route index element={&lt;Home /&gt;}&gt;\n    &lt;/Route&gt;\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n}\n<p>// After\nlet router = createBrowserRouter([{\npath: &quot;/&quot;,\nelement: &lt;Layout /&gt;,\nchildren: [{\nindex: true,\nelement: &lt;Home /&gt;,\n}]\n}]);</p>\n<p>function App() {\nreturn &lt;RouterProvider router={router} /&gt;\n}\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>If folks still prefer the JSX notation, they can leverage <code>createRoutesFromElements</code> (aliased from <code>createRoutesFromChildren</code> since they are not &quot;children&quot; in this usage):</p>\n<pre lang=\"jsx\"><code>let routes = createRoutesFromElements(\n  &lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot; element={&lt;Layout /&gt;}&gt;\n    &lt;Route index element={&lt;Home /&gt;}&gt;\n  &lt;/Route&gt;\n);\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

This can happen within more complex cobra file structures that have many different <code>init</code>s to be executed. Now, the check for groups has been moved to <code>ExecuteC</code> and provides more flexibility when working with grouped commands - <a href=\"https://github.com/marckhouzam\"><code>@​marckhouzam</code></a> (and shout out to <a href=\"https://github.com/aawsome\"><code>@​aawsome</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/andig\"><code>@​andig</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/KINGSABRI\"><code>@​KINGSABRI</code></a> for a deep investigation into this! 👏🏼)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v1.6.0</h2>\n<h3>Summer 2022 Release</h3>\n<p>Some exciting changes make their way to Cobra! Command completions continue to get better and better (including adding <code>--help</code> and <code>--version</code> automatic flags to the completions list). Grouping is now possible in your help output as well! And you can now use the <code>OnFinalize</code> method to cleanup things when all &quot;work&quot; is done.

Instead of always assuming that a tar archive is gzipped we check first if it is just a tar and apply the appropriate unpacking thereafter. An alternative implementation would be to extend the workflow template to allow a tar (non gzip) archive strategy which would allow to support both output and input. Happy to receive some feedback at this point!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease do not open a pull request until you have checked ALL of these:\r\n\r\n* [x] Create the PR as draft .\r\n* [ ] Run `make pre-commit -B` to fix codegen and lint problems.\r\n* [x] Sign-off your commits (otherwise the DCO check will fail).\r\n* [x] Use [a conventional commit message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) (otherwise the commit message check will fail).\r\n* [x] \"Fixes #\" is in both the PR title (for release notes) and this description (to automatically link and close the issue).\r\n* [x] Add unit or e2e tests. Say how you tested your changes. If you changed the UI, attach screenshots.\r\n* [x] Github checks are green.\r\n* [ ] Once required tests have passed, mark your PR \"Ready for review\".\r\n\r\nIf changes were requested, and you've made them, dismiss the review to get it reviewed again.\r\n",

Say how you tested your changes. If you changed the UI, attach screenshots.\r\n* [x] Github checks are green.\r\n* [ ] Once required tests have passed, mark your PR \"Ready for review\".\r\n\r\nIf changes were requested, and you've made them, dismiss the review to get it reviewed again.\r\n",

    "body": "Signed releases #9769 \r\nThis PR implements container images to be signed using ```sigstore/cosign```  It also consolidates the checksums of the cli-binaries into a single file then signs it.   \r\n\r\n#### Three GitHub secrets will need to be created before this PR is merged. The process to do this is listed below.\r\n\r\nTLDR: https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/git_support\r\n\r\n1. [Install Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation) on your workstation. Linux, Homebrew, and container options are available.  Execute the command ```cosign --version``` to verified it has been installed correctly.\r\n2. Create or have a valid GitHub PAT token available.\r\n3. Export your PAT as the environment variable \"GITHUB_TOKEN\"\r\n4. Execute ```cosign generate-key-pair github://argoproj/argo-workflows``` This will start the process of creating the GitHub Secrets automatically for you, and prompt you to enter a password.  This Password will be stored as the Github secret ```COSIGN_PASSWORD``` I would recommend to use well respected password generator such as KeePassXC or Bitwarden and use a paranoid level of characters of at least 32. \r\n5. Three GitHub secretes should have been created, please verify.  ```COSIGN_PASSWORD``` ```COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY``` & ```COSIGN_PUBLIC_KEY```\r\n6. Please comment on this PR with the newly created public key (cosign.pub)",

    "body": "Fixes #9669 \r\n\r\nIn containerset, the log is stored in the parent of the selected node.\r\nWe retrieve the log info through `workflow.status.nodes[nodeid]`\r\n\r\nit happens in the existing approach the `nodename - .[^.]*$` is same as `nodeid` of parent node for simple container set wf.\r\nHowever, when we have multiple container sets in a wf this is no longer valid.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nIn containerset the node name includes extra `.containername` e.g. `podname.container1`\r\nThe original code removes the container name when querying log so that we can find the correct node info/podname\r\n\r\nWhen retryStrategy is specified, the node name then becomes `podname(run0).container1`\r\nThis fix added optional removal of the `(run0)`.\r\n\r\nDue naming convention and validation, user won't be able to use `()` as part of node name\r\nIt now displays the following instead of UI panic\r\n--->\r\n\r\nTests:\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary>container set with retry</summary>\r\n\r\n  ```yaml\r\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\r\nkind: Workflow\r\nmetadata:\r\n  generateName: sequence-\r\n  labels:\r\n    workflows.argoproj.io/test: \"true\"\r\n  annotations:\r\n    workflows.argoproj.io/description: |\r\n      This workflow demonstrates running a sequence of containers within a single pod.\r\n    workflows.argoproj.io/version: \">= 3.1.0\"\r\nspec:\r\n  entrypoint: main\r\n  templates:\r\n    -

The test is looking for the \"Message\" but it showed up and then got cleared. It seems to me that what we're verifying here is that the activeDeadlineSeconds got passed to the Pod so I've changed the check to that.",
